Hello and welcome to our first programming café of the year!

This is a much more laid back event than our workshops and talks, just rock up and work on a project, and speak to other people about their projects!
We'll be encouraging people to do a brief show-and-tell towards the end, and you may end up spotlit in our newsletter!

The event will take place in the A32 Ada Lovelace laboratory. If you do not have access to the building (e.g. you are not a CompSci student) let us know when you arrive and we will let you into the building.

Learn how to use [Docker](https://docker.io) with Peter in this workshop.

This serves as a follow up to his talk from the first introduction event.

A Linux laptop or virtual machine (Ubuntu or Debian is fine) is highly reccommended to follow along, especially as there are no computers in the room we're using.

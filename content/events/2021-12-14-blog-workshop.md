Have you ever wanted a website? Making a blog is a great way to boost your online presence, and is also a really fun way to express yourself.

This first half of this workshop will be Dev Sec Zac going through how to make a nice website with the Hugo static site generator.

The second half will be Gen Sec James going through how to host your website with GitHub pages with a custom domain. 

If you follow along, by the end of this workshop you will have a website accessible on the world wide web!

Come along to our Christmas quiz! We have booked out the top floor of the Rose and Crown pub, next to Jubilee campus, and we will be having a fun HackSoc quiz, with a bit of a Christmas feel. The quiz consists of rounds devised by committee members, and you'll compete in teams. There are prizes for the winning team!

After the quiz we will be playing some party games, so be sure to come along!

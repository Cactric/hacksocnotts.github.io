# Welcome to Hacksoc!

To kick off the new academic year, we've got our try-it introduction event. In this event, we'll have talks on the following:

+ Introduction to game development
+ JPEG Compression
+ Toby's Talk

In addition to an overall introduction to the society, and an overview of how you can get involved in the Wider Nottingham Tech Community

The event will take place in the Buisness School South lecture theatre on Jubilee Campus, but will also be streamed [On our Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3cq7pgEjandUq9UHpEHaKw) because we may have to limit the number of people attending due to COVID rules.

There will be Pizza! üçï

After exams have finished, HackSoc will be doing our patriotic duty and hosting a BBQ to celebrate the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. This will be a great place to unwind from the stresses of exams, and as it is during the day, at 2pm, you can still go out to the street parties in the evening.

As this event is a BBQ, food and drink will be provided. If you are thinking of coming along, please can you fill out a quick form at [hacksoc.net/jubilee-bbq](https://hacksoc.net/jubilee-bbq) so we know how much food to get.

This event will be taking place on the island on the lake behind the Computer Science building at 2pm on Friday the 3rd of June.

This is going to be the last HackSoc event for the year, so be sure to come along!

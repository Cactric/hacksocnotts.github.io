Welcome to HackSoc!

This will be our first event of the year, and a good taster to give you
an idea of what kind of events we'll be running throughout the year. At
4:30pm, we'll be gathering in C33 where the committee will be giving
three short-ish talks on various tech-related topics:

 - An introduction to game development by our President
 - A talk about bug bounties by our Cyber Security Secretary
 - And two more, details to be confirmed

The event in whole is supposed to take around two hours, finishing
at approximately 6:30pm, to give you plenty of time to have dinner afterwards.

Also, we will be serving free pizza! üçï

No need to sign up for this (or any other) event, just come along and find
us in the Exchange Building on Jubilee Campus around 4:15. Any questions,
feel free to email us or send us a message on Discord. See you there!

On the 6th of October, HackSoc and Medieval Combat Society will be going out for a joint pub crawl! We'll start at the White Hart at 7pm!

This is a nice social event to start off the term, and while no, there is no real reason why *these* two societies have a joint pub crawl, it's always a fun night. No booking required, just find us at the White Hart (29 Gregory Street, Lenton)!

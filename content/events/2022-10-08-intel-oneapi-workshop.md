This event is a full day workshop running from 11am to 6pm, with free pizza at lunchtime. The 
presenters behind this event are academics from the University of Cambridge open zetta scale lab.

The event covers all the basics of Intelâ€™s SYCL implementation, including how to get 
started, program structure, unified shared memory, kernels, Intel Vtune profiler, buffers & 
accessors and reduction operations. This workshop is being taught by academics from Cambridge 
university who work on zetta scale compute and have significant experience working with 
heterogeneous compute technologies.

There will be some **free swag** up for grabs for those who  attend in addition to the **free 
pizza**!

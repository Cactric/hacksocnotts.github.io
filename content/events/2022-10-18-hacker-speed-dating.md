Ready, set, hack! Hacker speed dating is an opportunity to test your 
skills and work with others to solve a series of trivial challenges, were 
it not for the ever-rotating feed of projects you'll have to work on!

Get to work on a project and complete the task listed, but hurry and keep 
your code legible, because every so often you'll be booted off of one 
project and you'll have to start working on someone else's uncompleted 
task! How many will you complete? Will other's understand your code? Can 
you decipher theirs? Best of luck and Happy Hacking!
